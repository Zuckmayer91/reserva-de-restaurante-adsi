# Cutlery

This extension adds a cutlery yes/no option into the checkout of your TastyIgniter install.

This is free and doesn't require a license, but you can [donate to Ryan](https://github.com/sponsors/ryanmitchell), the developer behind it, to show your appreciation.


### Usage

Just add the component to the checkout page, and add `@component('cutleryField')` where you want it to appear (usually `cart/components/checkout/form.blade.php`).
